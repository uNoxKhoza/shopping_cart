## 🔧 How It Works

1. The program continuously prompts the user to enter:

   * A **food product**
   * The **price** of that product
2. Users can type a keyword like `exit` or `done` to stop adding more items.
3. Once the user is finished:

   * The full list of items is displayed
   * The **total cost** is calculated and shown

## 🧪 Sample Run

```
Enter food item: Apples  
Enter price: 10  

Enter food item: Bread  
Enter price: 15  

Enter food item (or type 'done' to finish): done

🧾 Your Shopping Cart:
- Apples: R10
- Bread: R15

💰 Total Cost: R25
```
